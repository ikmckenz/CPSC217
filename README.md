# CPSC217
University of Calgary CPSC 217 Python Assignments

I took this course back in Winter 2016. The assignments
rely on the SimpleGraphics library, which can usually be found 
somewhere [here](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~bdstephe/). I belive 
the more modern versions of this course use Python 3, however we used
Python 2 when I took it.
